## IDM Deployment Guide

**Standardized deployment process** for IDM environments, focusing on reliability, traceability and post-deployment verification.
Applies to IDM environments such as user management, authentication and directory services.

### Preparation Phase
✅ Verify access to the deployment environment  
✅ Ensure code is version-controlled and reviewed  
✅ Backup existing configuration and data  
✅ Validate that the staging environment is stable  
✅ Notify impacted teams of upcoming deployment  

### Deployment Steps
1. Pull latest approved build from repository  
2. Deploy configuration packages to staging  
3. Run pre-deployment validation scripts  
4. Execute automated smoke tests  
5. Deploy to production (under change window)  

### Verification
- Validate application accessibility  
- Confirm IDM services and API endpoints are reachable  
- Check logs for warnings or failed transactions  
- Verify integration with connected systems (CRM, CM, etc.)

### Rollback Procedure
If deployment fails or anomalies are detected :
1. Stop new incoming requests  
2. Restore backup configuration  
3. Validate restoration success  
4. Notify stakeholders and log incident details  

### Best Practices
- Use consistent naming conventions for builds and releases  
- Automate backup and verification whenever possible  
- Maintain detailed change logs for auditability
