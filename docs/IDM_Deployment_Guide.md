## IDM Deployment Guide

Standardized deployment process for IDM environments, ensuring reliability, traceability and post-deployment verification.  
Applies to identity management, authentication and directory services environments.  

Covers the full IDM deployment cycle, highlighting the QA role in each phase.


### Preparation
Before deployment, ensure the environment is ready and secure.

**Steps**
- Confirm access and permissions for deployment accounts  
- Ensure code and configurations are version-controlled and reviewed  
- Backup current configurations and databases  
- Validate the stability of staging or pre-production environments  
- Notify impacted teams (technical, support, security)

**QA Role**
- Ensure all changes have passed functional and integration testing  
- Prepare rollback and verification documentation  
- Verify that test data and credentials are anonymized  
- Coordinate with system administrators for post-deployment verification


### Deployment
Execute the deployment following the approved procedure, maintaining logs and traceability.

**Steps**
- Stop background services or scheduled tasks if needed  
- Pull the latest approved build from the repository  
- Deploy configuration or code packages  
- Run pre-deployment validation scripts  
- Execute automated smoke tests  
- Deploy to production within the change window  

**QA Role**
- Observe the deployment process and monitor logs in real time  
- Run smoke tests immediately after service restart  
- Capture and document any anomalies or error messages


### Verification
After deployment, confirm that IDM components are functioning as expected.

**Steps**
- Test user authentication and login flows  
- Confirm synchronization with directory services  
- Check access provisioning and de-provisioning logic  
- Review logs and error traces for anomalies  

**QA Role**
- Execute post-deployment test cases (user scenarios, lifecycle tests)  
- Compare expected vs. actual results  
- Validate log quality and error handling  
- Document results and share with the deployment team


### Rollback / Recovery
If deployment causes errors or service degradation.

**Steps**
- Stop new incoming requests if necessary  
- Restore backup configuration and databases  
- Revert to the last known stable version  
- Restart any disabled services  
- Verify restoration success and notify stakeholders  

**QA Role**
- Confirm the system has returned to expected behavior  
- Validate critical functionalities after recovery  
- Update incident and verification documentation


### Best Practices
Schedule deployments during maintenance windows.    
Use consistent naming conventions for builds and releases.    
Automate backups and verification where possible.    
Maintain detailed logs for audit purposes.    
Standardize QA checklists across releases.
